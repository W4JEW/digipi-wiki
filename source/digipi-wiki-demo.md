# DigiPi Wiki

## Overview

This is a quick demo on how to use a WYSIWYG Markdown editor to create documentation for the DigiPi wiki

## Hardware

You can build your own DigiPi by purchasing the following items:

- [Raspberry Pi Zero W/2, 3B, 3B+, or 4](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Model-2019-Quad-Bluetooth/dp/B07TC2BK1X/)
- [Micro SD card (16 GB is PLENTY)](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Endurance-32GB-Micro-Adapter/dp/B07B98GXQT/ref=sr_1_8)
- [PiTFT 1.3" Display - Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4484)

## Additional Information

Refer to the original DigiPi documentation on Craig's website - until we get our wiki act situated. :-)

[The KM6LYW Radio DigiPi Project](http://craiger.org/digipi/)

## Pictures

There are two ways to add pictures:

1. Using a link to an image that's already available on another site (not desirable - if there are any changes made to the other site, or the picture is deleted, then our content is broken)
2. Adding the image directly to the documentation. This requires ensuring you have a copy of the file locally.

Here's a photo on another website:

The text I typed in above will show up in the final project when you hover over the image on the website

Here's an example of an image locally maintained

Notice how I renamed the file - I'm trying to standardize on all lower-case names with hyphens - NO SPACES in filenames!!!

## GitHub

Next, I'll show you how simple it is to contribute to the Wiki via GitHub
