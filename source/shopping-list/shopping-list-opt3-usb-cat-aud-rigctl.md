## Radio Supports CAT Control & Audio via USB

This is the simplest option from a hardware-build standpoint as most of the hardware needed is already inm your radio!

Many modern radios provide operators with options for remotely controlling their radio ("rig") via CAT (Computer Aided Transceiver) Control. 

Different vendors use different terminology. For example:

Icom refers to CAT control as CI-V. CI-V stands for "Computer Interface - Version 5".

Kenwood and Yaesu use CAT.

In addition to CAT/CI-V control, many radio manufacturers also provide a USB audio interface over the same physical USB connection.

Examples

A few examples of radios that include both CAT control and audio over the same USB connection:

- Icom IC-705

- Icom IC-7100

Yaesu FT-991A
